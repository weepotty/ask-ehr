However, over the past year, the frequency of his seizures has increased, prompting a referral for further assessment and management.",

Unfortunately, Mr. Smith developed nausea with sodium valproate, leading to a further change in medication.",

Following this adjustment, Mr. Smith reported no further seizures. His neurological examination was unremarkable, and he is now adhering to the treatment regimen without difficulty. This medication has significantly improved his seizure control.",

He described the headache as a dull, constant pain, which had lasted for several hours. No new neurological symptoms such as seizures or altered consciousness were reported. The clinical examination showed no focal neurological deficits. Mr. Smith's medical history includes a history of temporal lobe epilepsy, for which he has been stable with Lamotrigine. There were no signs of acute exacerbation of his epilepsy. After appropriate investigations, it was concluded that his symptoms were likely related to a non-neurological cause, such as a vestibular issue or tension headache.",
